# Flood Prediction System 
A machine learning model for flood prediction, leveraging geospatial and atmospheric data to enhance forecasting accuracy. The system analyses key environmental factors to support early warning and disaster management efforts.

##  Features
- Predicts **Flood Probability** from environmental features.
- Uses **Gradient Boosting Regressor** for accurate predictions.
- **Feature Importance plot** to explain the model.
- Adds **Latitude and Longitude** to simulate Kerala locations (for visualization, not training).
- Includes performance metrics: **MSE**, **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **R¬≤ score**.
